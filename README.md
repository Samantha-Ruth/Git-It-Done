# Git-It-Done

Search for open issues in GitHub. 

## Description

This project's goal was to create a site where one could find open issues in current GitHub accounts.  When the user enters a GitHub account, the application will pull up that user's GitHub repositories on the right side of the screen and show whether that repository has any open issues.  If it doesn't, there will be a blue checkmark. If there are open issues, there will be a red x and the number of issues open.  The user can also search open issues by topic, filtering by Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

When the user clicks on the repository, they are taken to a new page with each issue in that repository on a separate line.  When the user clicks on the issue, it will take you to the issue in GitHub.

The application was built using API fetches while integrating javaScript and HTML styling with Bootstrap. 

This project helped me understand API fetches and promises, as well as building dynamic styling and events in javaScript.  It also taught me about edge cases and how to provide error handling for the app.
